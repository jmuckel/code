# code
A collection of code and projects from my career. These will be code samples and examples of issues I've solved, not entire working projects.

Most of these will be various WordPress and Drupal projects. However there should also be samples of SQL, AJAX, pure HTML/CSS, and much more. The files will have a comment block at the top briefly explaining the project and what the file/code is doing.

My name is Jeremy Muckel and you can reach me at jeremymuckel@gmail.com if you have any questions. A copy of my resume will be included for your conveince.
